## This is a Game-engine written in C++<br />
It is only a basic structure where it is possibile to write a game using C++. <br />
To implement a game you need to add additional components, 
such as a map, characters, a menu.<br />
The engine is useful to decide how the various components of the game are loaded, 
for example you can create a menu and decide the right sequence of files and images to start playing.<br />
The structure also offers the possibility to receive error logs from various components and save them in a special directory.<br />
